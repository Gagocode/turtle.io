# turtle.io
This is just a small website thing that I made in my free time, and for now I'm stopping adding new additions and updates and redoing this
from scratch. I'll also be fixing some small UI bugs and other text here and there, but that's about it. You are free to use any of my code here, but please do
Please credit me if you were to use this in your own project.
Thank you!
